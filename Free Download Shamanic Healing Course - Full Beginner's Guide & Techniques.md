## What is Shamanic Healing? A Beginner's Introduction

Shamanic healing is an ancient practice that addresses the spiritual or energetic roots of illness and imbalance. Unlike conventional medicine, which primarily focuses on the physical symptoms, shamanic healing works on the energetic and spiritual dimensions of the individual. This holistic approach aims to restore harmony and balance within the individual and between the individual and their environment.

**Key Concepts in Shamanic Healing:**

*   **Spirit World Connection:** Shamanic practitioners believe in a spirit world that is accessible through altered states of consciousness. They journey into this world to seek guidance, healing, and power.
*   **Soul Retrieval:** This is a core shamanic practice that involves retrieving lost or fragmented parts of the soul, which can occur due to trauma, loss, or other challenging life experiences.
*   **Power Animal Retrieval:** Power animals are spirit guides that offer protection, strength, and wisdom. Connecting with a power animal can provide valuable support on your healing journey.
*   **Extraction Healing:** This involves removing unwanted energies or entities that may be causing illness or imbalance.
*   **Working with the Elements:** Shamanic practices often incorporate the elements of earth, air, fire, and water for grounding, purification, and transformation.

Understanding these core concepts is crucial before embarking on a shamanic healing course. It provides a solid foundation upon which you can build your knowledge and skills.
