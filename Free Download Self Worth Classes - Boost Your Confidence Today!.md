## Why is Understanding Self-Worth So Important?

**Self-worth** is the foundation upon which you build your life. It's your internal sense of being good enough, valuable, and worthy of love and respect, simply because you exist. It's not about your achievements, your possessions, or what others think of you. It's about your inherent value as a human being.

Without a solid foundation of self-worth, you may experience:

*   **Anxiety and Depression:** Constant self-doubt and negative self-talk can lead to feelings of anxiety and depression.
*   **Difficulties in Relationships:** If you don't value yourself, you may settle for unhealthy relationships or struggle to assert your needs.
*   **Procrastination and Lack of Motivation:** Believing you're not good enough can paralyze you and prevent you from pursuing your goals.
*   **Fear of Failure:** A fear of not measuring up can hold you back from taking risks and reaching your full potential.
*   **Codependency:** Relying on others for your sense of worth can lead to unhealthy attachments and a lack of personal boundaries.
