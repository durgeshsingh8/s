## What are Short-Term Goals and Why Do They Matter?

**Short-term goals** are objectives you aim to achieve within a relatively short period, typically ranging from a few days to a few months. They act as stepping stones towards larger, more ambitious long-term goals. Without these stepping stones, the long journey can feel overwhelming and discouraging.

**Here's why short-term goals are so important:**

*   **Provide Focus and Direction:** They help you concentrate your efforts on specific, achievable tasks.
*   **Boost Motivation:** Completing short-term goals provides a sense of accomplishment, fueling your motivation to keep going.
*   **Track Progress:**  Easily monitor your progress and make necessary adjustments along the way.
*   **Increase Productivity:**  Breaking down tasks into smaller chunks makes them less daunting, leading to increased productivity.
*   **Reduce Overwhelm:**  Avoid feeling overwhelmed by focusing on the immediate steps needed to reach your desired outcome.
*   **Build Momentum:** Success breeds success. Each completed short-term goal builds momentum, making it easier to achieve the next.
