## Understanding the Six Dimensions of Wellness

The "Six Degrees of Wellness" model emphasizes that wellness isn't just about physical health; it's a multifaceted concept encompassing six interconnected dimensions: **emotional, intellectual, physical, social, spiritual, and environmental**. Neglecting any one of these dimensions can negatively impact your overall well-being. Let's delve into each one:

*   **Emotional Wellness:** This involves understanding and managing your emotions, coping with stress effectively, and having a positive outlook on life. It's about being resilient, self-aware, and able to build healthy relationships. Think of it as your emotional intelligence.

*   **Intellectual Wellness:** This dimension focuses on continuous learning, expanding your knowledge, and engaging in mentally stimulating activities. It's about cultivating curiosity, problem-solving skills, and a lifelong love of learning. Reading, puzzles, and creative pursuits all contribute to intellectual wellness.

*   **Physical Wellness:** This is perhaps the most commonly understood dimension, encompassing exercise, nutrition, sleep, and avoiding harmful habits. It's about taking care of your body and making choices that promote physical health and longevity.

*   **Social Wellness:** This involves building and maintaining healthy relationships, contributing to your community, and having a sense of belonging. It's about developing strong social support networks and engaging in meaningful interactions with others.

*   **Spiritual Wellness:** This dimension focuses on finding meaning and purpose in life, connecting with something larger than yourself, and living in accordance with your values. It can involve religion, meditation, spending time in nature, or engaging in acts of service.

*   **Environmental Wellness:** This involves understanding the impact of your environment on your health and taking steps to protect it. It's about living sustainably, reducing your carbon footprint, and creating a healthy and safe living space.
