## Advanced Tips for Optimizing Space Engineers on Linux

Once you've got the basics down, you can start exploring more advanced techniques for optimizing your system for Space Engineers:

*   **Install Proprietary Graphics Drivers:** If you're using an NVIDIA or AMD graphics card, install the proprietary drivers for better performance. Your distribution's package manager should provide instructions on how to do this.
*   **Use a Gaming Kernel:** Some custom kernels are designed for gaming and can provide performance improvements. Research and install a gaming kernel at your own risk, as it may void your warranty.
*   **Optimize System Services:** Disable unnecessary system services to free up resources for Space Engineers. Be careful when disabling services, as some may be essential for system stability.
*   **Use a Solid State Drive (SSD):** Installing Space Engineers on an SSD can significantly improve load times and overall performance.
*   **Overclock Your CPU and GPU:** Overclocking can boost performance, but it can also damage your hardware if done incorrectly. Research and proceed with caution.
