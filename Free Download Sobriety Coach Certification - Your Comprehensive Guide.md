## What is a Sobriety Coach?

A sobriety coach, also known as a recovery coach or sober companion, plays a vital role in supporting individuals striving for sobriety. They provide encouragement, accountability, and practical guidance to navigate the challenges of early recovery and beyond.

*   **Preventing Relapse:** Identifying potential relapse triggers and developing strategies to prevent relapse.
*   **Advocating for Clients:** Speaking on behalf of clients when necessary, such as during family interventions or court appearances.
